# Perceptron Learning Algorithm with Perceptron Trick

The perceptron learning algorithm is a simple model used for binary classification. It works by adjusting its weights based on misclassifications, aiming to find a decision boundary that separates the two classes. One key aspect of the perceptron learning algorithm is the "perceptron trick," a weight update rule that helps the perceptron converge to a solution.

#### Perceptron Trick Overview:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize the weights to small random values, and include a bias term (intercept).

2. **Training:**
   - For each training iteration:
     - Randomly select a misclassified point from the training dataset.
     - Update the weights based on the perceptron trick.

3. **Perceptron Trick Update Rule:**
   - For a misclassified point with features \(X\) and true label \(y\), perform the following update:
     - \( \text{{weights}} = \text{{weights}} + \text{{learning\_rate}} \times (y - \text{{predicted\_label}}) \times X \)

   - Here, `predicted_label` is the output of the perceptron for the given input.

4. **Repeat:**
   - Repeat the training iterations until the perceptron converges (i.e., makes no mistakes on the training data) or for a predefined number of iterations.

#### Usage:

```python
def perceptron(X, y, learning_rate=0.1, num_iterations=1000):
    # ... (rest of the perceptron implementation)

    for i in range(num_iterations):
        # Randomly select a misclassified point
        j = np.random.randint(1, len(X))

        # Calculate predicted label using the current weights
        y_hat = step(np.dot(X[j], weights))

        # Update weights using the perceptron trick
        weights = weights + learning_rate * (y[j] - y_hat) * X[j]

    return weights
```

#### Notes:
- The learning rate (`learning_rate`) controls the step size of weight updates.
- The perceptron trick aims to adjust the weights such that the decision boundary separates the classes more accurately.

By leveraging the perceptron trick, the perceptron learning algorithm can efficiently learn a linear decision boundary for binary classification tasks.
